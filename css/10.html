A simple analogy: Suppose you live in a polar region in an igloo, you make a fire to keep yourself warm. Soon, the place is warm and cozy, and you increase the flame for more warmth. Then, the ice around you begins to melt, and slowly, over a period of time, your house, the igloo, is lost. This is how global warming works, only, the igloo here is the earth.
